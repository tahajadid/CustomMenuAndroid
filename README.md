# CustomMenuAndroid

This project implement the idea of setting a custom menu where Burger Menu that can be hidden in the Fragment without any impact of the Navigation of the App.

## Screenshots

In this Main Fragment (DashBoardFragment) we hide the icon of burger menu and we don't impact the backStack of the Fragments Navigation 


In the other Fragments we need to show the icon of Burger Menu and just modify the MENU_LIST
